# Introduction

This repository is a simple demo playground to test out golang publisher/consumer microservices using RabbitMQ as a message broker and docker with hot reload using air.

## Getting started

Open this repository in your favorite code editor and use `docker compose up` to startup the development stack and start coding. The go applications will be running within docker containers with the code mounted to be automatically detected for hot reload using [Air](https://github.com/air-verse/air)
